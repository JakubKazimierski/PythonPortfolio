    '''
    Have the function WeightedPath(strArr) 
    take strArr which will be an array of 
    strings which models a non-looping weighted Graph. 
    The structure of the array will be as follows: 
    The first element in the array will be the number
    of nodes N (points) in the array as a string. 
    The next N elements will be the nodes which can be anything 
    (A, B, C .. Brick Street, Main Street .. etc.). Then after 
    the Nth element, the rest of the elements in the array will 
    be the connections between all of the nodes along with their 
    weights (integers) separated by the pipe symbol (|). They will 
    look like this: (A|B|3, B|C|12 .. Brick Street|Main Street|14 .. etc.). 
    Although, there may exist no connections at all.

    An example of strArr may be: 
    ["4","A","B","C","D","A|B|1","B|D|9","B|C|3","C|D|4"]. Your 
    program should return the shortest path when the weights are 
    added up from node to node from the first Node to the last Node 
    in the array separated by dashes. So in the example above the 
    output should be A-B-C-D. Here is another example with strArr 
    being ["7","A","B","C","D","E","F","G","A|B|1","A|E|9","B|C|2","C|D|1","D|F|2","E|D|6","F|G|2"]. 
    The output for this array should be A-B-C-D-F-G. There will only ever 
    be one shortest path for the array. If no path between the first and 
    last node exists, return -1. The array will at minimum have two nodes. 
    Also, the connection A-B for example, means that A can get to B and B can 
    get to A. A path may not go through any Node more than once.

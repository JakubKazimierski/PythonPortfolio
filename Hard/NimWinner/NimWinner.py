    Have the function NimWinner(arr) 
    take the array of integers stored 
    in arr which will represent the amount 
    of coins in each pile. 
    
    For example: [2, 4, 1, 3] means there are 
    4 piles of coins and there are 2 coins in the 
    first pile, 4 in the second pile, etc. Nim is played 
    by each player removing any number of coins from only 
    one pile, and the winner is the player who picks up the 
    last coin. 
    
    For example: if arr is [1, 2, 3] then for example player 1 can 
    remove 2 coins from the last pile which results in [1, 2, 1]. 
    Then player 2 can remove 1 coin from the first pile which results 
    in [0, 2, 1], etc. The player that has the last possible move taking 
    the last coin(s) from a pile wins the game. Your program should output 
    either 1 or 2 which represents which player has a guaranteed win with 
    perfect play for the Nim game.

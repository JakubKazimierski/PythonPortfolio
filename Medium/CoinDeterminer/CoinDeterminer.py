    Worst case is call stack at depth lenght of A,
    next for each stack level we try each of c coins' value, to get best result
    best solutions are storing in chache, and next are based on this cache.
    This solution finds shortest way from Val_to_change to 1, and each time improve solution

    Have the function CoinDeterminer(num) 
    take the input, which will be an integer 
    ranging from 1 to 250, and return an integer 
    output that will specify the least number of coins, 
    that when added, equal the input integer. Coins are 
    based on a system as follows: there are coins representing 
    the integers 1, 5, 7, 9, and 11. 
    
    So for example: if num is 16, then the output should be 2 
    because you can achieve the number 16 with the coins 9 and 7. 
    If num is 25, then the output should be 3 because you can 
    achieve 25 with either 11, 9, and 5 coins or with 9, 9, and 7 coins.

    Down Top approach of Minimum Coin Change Problem
    Complexity is O(A*c) where A is value to change
    and c are amount of values of coins. For each value from
    1 to Val_to_change we do c comparitions for each value
    to get best result, and choose the best way, next iteration
    is based on this best way, so this solution does not need to 
    remember all steps, just chooses the best one.

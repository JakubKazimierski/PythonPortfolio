    '''
    Have the function LinearCongruence(str) 
    read the str parameter being passed which 
    will be a linear congruence equation in the 
    form: "ax = b (mod m)" Your goal is to solve 
    for x and return the number of solutions to x. 
    
    For example: if str is "32x = 8 (mod 4)" then 
    your program should return 4 because the answers 
    to this equation can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3.

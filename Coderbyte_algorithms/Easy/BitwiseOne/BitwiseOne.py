def BitwiseOne(strArr):
    '''
    Have the function BitwiseOne(strArr) 
    take the array of strings stored in strArr, 
    which will only contain two strings of equal 
    length that represent binary numbers, and return 
    a final binary string that performed the bitwise 
    OR operation on both strings. 
    
    A bitwise OR operation places a 0 in the new string 
    where there are zeroes in both binary strings, 
    otherwise it places a 1 in that spot. 
    
    For example: if strArr is ["1001", "0100"] 
    then your program should return the string "1101"

        # fill with zeros missing indexes in range of length input

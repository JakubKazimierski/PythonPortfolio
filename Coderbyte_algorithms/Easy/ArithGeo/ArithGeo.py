def ArithGeo(arr):
    '''
    Have the function ArithGeo(arr) take the array 
    of numbers stored in arr and return the string 
    "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern 
    or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. 
    If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. 
    An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, 
    where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant 
    or common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. 
    Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, 
    and no array will contain all the same elements.

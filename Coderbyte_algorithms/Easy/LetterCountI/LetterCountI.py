def LetterCountI(strParam):
    '''
    Have the function LetterCountI(str) 
    take the str parameter being passed 
    and return the first word with the 
    greatest number of repeated letters. 
    For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" 
    should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) 
    and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. 
    If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. 
    Words will be separated by spaces.

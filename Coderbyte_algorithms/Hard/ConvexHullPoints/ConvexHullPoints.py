    Have the function ConvexHullPoints(strArr) 
    take strArr which will be an array of integer 
    coordinates that exist on a Cartesian plane in 
    the form: (x,y). Your program should return the 
    minimum number of points that are needed to form a 
    convex hull around all the points. 
    
    For example: if the input is ["(2,2)", "(3,1)", "(2,6)", "(0,-2)"] 
    then your program should return 3 because only 3 points are needed 
    to create a convex hull that encloses all the points. The input array 
    will always contain at least 3 points.

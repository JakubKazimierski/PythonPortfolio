    Have the function MatrixPath(strArr) 
    take the strArr parameter being passed which 
    will be a 2D matrix of 0 and 1's of some arbitrary size, 
    and determine if a path of 1's exists from the top-left of 
    the matrix to the bottom-right of the matrix while moving 
    only in the directions: up, down, left, and right. If a path 
    exists your program should return the string true, otherwise 
    your program should return the number of locations in the matrix 
    where if a single 0 is replaced with a 1, a path of 1's will be 
    created successfully. If a path does not exist and you cannot create 
    a path by changing a single location in the matrix from a 0 to a 1, 
    then your program should return the string not possible. 
    
    For example: if strArr is ["11100", "10011", "10101", "10011"] 
    then this looks like the following matrix:

    1 1 1 0 0
    1 0 0 1 1
    1 0 1 0 1
    1 0 0 1 1

    For the input above, a path of 1's from the top-left to the 
    bottom-right does not exist. But, we can change a 0 to a 1 in 2 places 
    in the matrix, namely at locations: [0,3] or [1,2]. So for this input
    your program should return 2. The top-left and bottom-right of the input 
    matrix will always be 1's.

## Description

This directory contains simple blog, created by framework Django. To manage this I learned from Corey Schafer YouTube channel, where he described
step by step how to gain final site.

## Directories

In subdirectories are placed all necessary for this project files. Part of them are created automatically, and other ones are created by me.

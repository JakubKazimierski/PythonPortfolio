    You're given a non-empty array of positive
    integers where each integer represents the 
    maximum number of steps you can take forward
    in the array. For example, if the element at
    index 1 is 3, you can go from index 1 to index 2,
    3 or 4. 

    Write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps
    needed to reach the final index.

    Note that jumping from index i to index i+x always
    constitutes one jump, no matter how large x is.
    
    Jumps are > 0.

class BinaryTree:
    '''
    Class for building tree.
    
    Write a function that takes in a BinaryTree
    and returns its max path sum.

    A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree,
    where no node is connected to more than two other
    nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes
    in a particular path.

    Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node
    and a right child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree
    nodes themselves or None/null.

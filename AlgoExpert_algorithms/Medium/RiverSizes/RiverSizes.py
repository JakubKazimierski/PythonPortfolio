def riverSizes(matrix):
    '''
    You're given a two-dimensional array
    (a matrix) of potentially unequal height
    and width containing only 0s and 1s.
    Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents
    part of a river. A river consist of any number
    of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically
    adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number
    of adjacent 1s forming a river, determines it's size.

    Note that a river can twist. In other words, it doesn't 
    have to be a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal
    line. It can be L-shaped, for example.

    Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all
    rivers represented in the input matrix. The sizes don't need to
    in any particular order.

    You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an 
    AncestralTree class that have an ancestor property pointing to their
    youngest ancestor. The first input is the top ancestor in an ancestral
    tree (i.e. the only instance that has no ancestor--its ancestor property
    points to None/null), and the other two inputs are descendants in the
    ancestral tree.

    Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two
    descendants.

    Note that a descendant is considered its own ancestor. So in the simple 
    ancestral tree below, the youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is
    node A.

    Have the function NonrepeatingCharacter(str) 
    take the str parameter being passed, which 
    will contain only alphabetic characters and spaces, 
    and return the first non-repeating character.
    For example: if str is "agettkgaeee" then your 
    program should return k. 
    The string will always contain at least one 
    character and there will always be at least 
    one non-repeating character.

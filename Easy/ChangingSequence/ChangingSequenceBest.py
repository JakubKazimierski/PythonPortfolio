def ChangingSequence(arr):
    '''
    Have the function ChangingSequence(arr) 
    take the array of numbers stored in arr 
    and return the index at which the numbers stop increasing 
    and begin decreasing or stop decreasing 
    and begin increasing. For example: if arr is [1, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, 1] 
    then your program should return 3 because 6 is the last point 
    in the array where the numbers were increasing and the next number 
    begins a decreasing sequence. The array will contain at least 3 numbers 
    and it may contains only a single sequence, increasing or decreasing. 
    If there is only a single sequence in the array, 
    then your program should return -1. 
    Indexing should begin with 0.

            # If sign of multiplication is different sequence changed
            if difference*(arr[j]-arr[j+1])<=0:

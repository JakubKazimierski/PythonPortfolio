    Have the function ProductDigits(num) 
    take the num parameter being passed 
    which will be a positive integer, 
    and determine the least amount of digits 
    you need to multiply to produce it. 
    
    For example: if num is 24 then you can multiply 8 by 3 
    which produces 24, so your program should return 2 
    because there is a total of only 2 digits that are 
    needed. 
    
    Another example: if num is 90, you can multiply 10 * 9, 
    so in this case your program should output 3 
    because you cannot reach 90 without using a total of 3 
    digits in your multiplication.

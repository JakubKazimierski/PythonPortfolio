    Have the function AdditivePersistence(num) 
    take the num parameter being passed which will always be 
    a positive integer and return its additive persistence 
    which is the number of times you must add the digits in num 
    until you reach a single digit. 
    For example: if num is 2718 then your program should return 2 
    because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9.
